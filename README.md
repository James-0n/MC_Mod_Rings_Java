# MC_Mod_Rings_Java
My own Minecraft mod compatible with Fabric API 1.16 and above. Adds six wearable rings to the base game, each with its own custom texture and crafting recipe. They confer unique special abilities when equipped. 

Configuration Instructions:
Download .jar file (this is the mod) and the mods folder of Minecraft (/.minecraft/mods). The mod defines the rings' craftin recipes, textures, and item qualities, but it does
not give them enchantments. For this, download the datapack folder RingEffects and move it to the datapack folder of your worldsave (/.minecraft/mods/New World/datapacks).

Crafting Instructions:
All crafting recipes are constructed of seven gold ingots and a material block *see pictures folder*. Once you craft a ring, you must also craft a knowledge book to learn its
unique power (recipe also in pictures). If you craft a knowledge book with the ring equipped in your OFFHAND slot, you will be given the ring's associated status effects.

Ring Powers:
Ruby Ring --> Immunity to fire damage and six extra hearts of health 
Onyx Ring --> Invisibility and night vision
Sapphire Ring --> Waterbreathing, 400% increased swim speed, better visbility and mining speed while underwater
Diamond Ring --> 60% boost to movement/mining speed and 30% boost to attack speed
Quartz Ring --> Immunity to fall damage and increases damage of all attacks by 1.5 hearts of health
Emerald Ring --> Adds 5 to the luck attribute, makes "Hero of the Village" effect permanent
