Configuration Instructions:

Download rings-x-1.0.0.jar (the mod) and move/copy to the mods folder of Minecraft */.minecraft/mods*. This defines the rings' crafting recipes, textures, and item qualities, but it does not give them powers. For this, download RingEffects and move it to the datapack folder of your worldsave */.minecraft/saves/Your World Name Here/datapacks*.

Crafting Instructions:

All crafting recipes are composed of seven gold ingots and a mineral block (see Index folder). The recipes are 'shaped', meaning the position at which you place each crafting material matters. Once you obtain a ring, you must also craft a knowledge book to learn its unique power (recipe also in Index). If you craft a knowledge book while a ring is equipped in your OFFHAND slot, you will be given that ring's powers.

Ring Powers:

Ruby Ring --> Immunity to fire/lava damage and six extra hearts of health 

Onyx Ring --> Invisibility and night vision

Sapphire Ring --> Waterbreathing, 400% increased swim speed, better visibility and mining speed while underwater

Diamond Ring --> 60% boost to movement/mining speed and 30% boost to attack speed

Quartz Ring --> Immunity to fall damage and increases attack power by 1.5 hearts

Emerald Ring --> Adds 5 to the luck attribute, makes "Hero of the Village" effect permanent

*Note: All non-boolean effects will stack with any boosts from other items in the game. However, only one ring's powers may be active at a time i.e. learning the power of
another ring clears the effects of your previous ring.*
